  <h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p style="line-height: 3;font-size:14px;margin-top:10px">We want everyone who visits the Halleyx website and uses our platform to feel welcome and find the experience rewarding.<br></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:14px;line-height: 1.8;margin-left:20px">To help us ensure a positive experience for everyone, we've been using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1.</li><br><li style="font-size:14px;line-height: 1;margin-left:20px"> These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user-friendly for everyone.</li><br>

<li style="font-size:14px;line-height: 1.8;margin-left:20px">The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA, and AAA). We've chosen Level AA as the target for the Halleyx website and platform.</li><br>

<li style="font-size:14px;line-height: 1.8;margin-left:20px">By ensuring a Level AA accessibility conformance, we allow for assistive technology such as screen readers, braille displays, plugins, and browser extensions to add further functionality needed by the individual user.</li><br>
<li style="font-size:14px;line-height: 1;margin-left:20px">Halleyx website is considered to be WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant.</li><br>
</ul>
<b style="margin-bottom:10px">What are we doing?</b><br>

<p style="line-height: 3;font-size:14px;margin-bottom:10px">At Halleyx, we are committed to ensuring a good experience for all users, and we have taken several measures to achieve this:<br></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:14px;line-height: 1;margin-left:20px;margin-top:10px">We have stated our commitment to accessibility in internal employee policies</li><br>
<li style="font-size:14px;line-height: 1;margin-left:20px">We offer accessibility training to all employees</li><br>
<li style="font-size:14px;line-height: 1.8;margin-left:20px">We have developed an internal design system of reusable components that have been holistically tested for accessibility</li><br>
<li style="font-size:14px;line-height: 1;margin-left:20px">We use our own automated accessibility checks for testing everything we build</li><br>
<li style="font-size:14px;line-height: 1;margin-left:20px">We have accessibility professionals conduct manual audits of all new features released</li><br>
<li style="font-size:14px;line-height: 1.6;margin-left:20px">We give out a monthly Accessibility Award to internal teams that have made a special effort to ensure our products are inclusive; this improves our own culture around building accessible products</li><br>
</ul>
